	<h1>The Role of Digital Humanities</h1>
<div class=content>
	<p>
 
	<br>
	<br>
Using digital humanities tools, one of the things I try to do is verify my claim that literary authors were,
in fact, engaging with the mathematical theories of their day. The graph on the right represents my attempt to 
model the primary topics (hence "topic modelling") in the major works of Mary Wollstonecraft. According 
to this output, the vocabulary of mathematical thinking appears nowhere
in the corpus. 
	</p>
	<p>
		Yet, because I have written on probability in her fiction, I know quantitative 
reasoning is an important part of Wollstonecraft's view of the universe. So one conclusion might be that topic modeling 
may not be the best tool for establishing subtle or secondary connections, like the link between mathematics 
and individual authors. But it might still be helpful for establishing larger scale tendencies, which remains to be seen.
