<h1 class="em">The Role of Digital Humanities</h1>
<div class="dhrole">
	<p>
As critics and digital humanists like Johanna Drucker remind us, mathematical models should not be 
mistaken for an absolute guarantee of objective certainty. And Richard Jean So argues that models are 
useful for revealing errors, and errors, he claims "should be thought 
of as a “constitutive part of science […] something to be integrated formally into our research,” instead 
of something to be merely “tolerated or avoided” ("All Models Are Wrong"). 
	<br>
	<br>
These two claims throw into relief some of the problems with the graph exhibited on this 
page. Using digital humanities tools, one of the things I try to do is verify my claim that literary authors were,
in fact, engaging with the mathematical theories of their day. This graph represents my attempt to 
model the primary topics ("topic modelling") in the major works of Mary Wollstonecraft. According 
to this output, the vocabulary of mathematical thinking appears nowhere
in the corpus. Yes, as I have written on probability in Wollstonecraft's fiction, I know quantitative 
reasoning is an important part of Wollstonecraft's view of the universe. So one conclusion might be that topic modeling 
may not be the best tool for establishing subtle or secondary connections, like the link between mathematics 
and individual authors. But it might still be help for establish larger scale tendencies, which remains to be seen.
