<h1 class="em">The Role of Digital Humanities</h1>
<div class="content">
	<p>
As critics and digital humanists like Johanna Drucker remind us, mathematical models should not be 
mistaken for an absolute guarantee of objective certainty. And Richard Jean So makes the important point
that what models can do well, sometimes, is to expose an errors, and errors, he claims "should be thought 
of as a “constitutive part of science […] something to be integrated formally into our research,” instead 
of something to be merely “tolerated or avoided” ("All Models Are Wrong"). 
	<br>
	<br>
Taking these two points into consideration can clarify what is wrong with the graph exhibited on this 
page, and why what's wrong with this graph adds support to arguments in favor of close reading. Using 
digital humanities tools, one of the things I try to do is verify my claim that literary authors were
in fact engaging with the mathematical theories of their day. This graph represents my attempt to 
model all the primary topics ("topic modelling") in the major works of Mary Wollstonecraft. According 
to this output, mathematics, numbers, and the larger vocabulary of quantitative thinking appears nowhere
in the work of a fundamentally important feminist and social theorist. This conclusion comes in spite of 
the fact that I've written a paper on the role of probability in Wollstonecraft's novels. ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
