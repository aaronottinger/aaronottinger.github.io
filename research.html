<div class="content">
	<p>
	The warrant for my current manuscript, "Astral Romanticism: Mathematics, Poetics, Models, and Realism," is that literary authors, from the mid-eighteenth century to the early Victorian period,
	incorporated a variety of old and new mathematical ideas to posit a new kind of objectivity, a "view from nowhere" pitched somewhere between science and fiction.
	</p>
	<p>
	With this updated version of objectivity in hand, as the major claim for this project goes, select theorists and authors of this period viewed the literary book not just as a machine but as a model, similar to the algorithmic models
	of the digital age.
	</p>	
	<p>
	This comparison between literary models of the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries and algorithmic models of today is important because of the way it opens up the  
	limits of reaslism. Exploring varieties of realism, from mathematics to literature, physics, and digital humanities, this book redifines a particular, performative 
	brand of literature neither as strictly a human construct nor as hyperbolically a scientific truth. Rather, it attempts to reposition literature as an interface for moral and epistemological 
	experimentation, and with ontological consequences.
