	<p>
	My current manuscript, "Astral Romanticism: Mathematics, Poetics, and Realisms," looks at the way literary authors from the mid-eighteenth century to the early Victorian period
		incorporated a variety of old and new mathematical ideas to posit a new kind of objectivity, or a new way of viewing the self and its relationship to the world from a perspective outside of this relationship, i.e. "the view from nowhere."
	</p>
	<p>
		The first question is why someone would want to study this subject matter? It seems like an outdated idea, debunked by postmodernism, that there is a view from outside of the world (and numerous philosophers today would argue that there is not even a "world"). 
	Indeed, philosophers and literary critics continue to critique realism for its essentialist claims, for instance, that there is one and only one reading (the *correct* one) of a poem. Or, there is one true history and that's the only history that is. Here's another way of thinking about 
		realism: There is the world that we see, smell, touch, and taste, and there is the real world which is made up of objective properties only, such as an element's atomic number or the speed of light.
		
		The problem is that these are different ways of thinking about realism and thus the reason why my investigation is important is that the eighteenth century marks the period when philosophers and artists were starting to have a more sophisticated and nuanced discussion about 
		how these realisms coincided and departed. I examine literature in particular because it represents a strange domain where different realisms, subjective/practical and objective/theoretical, or poetic and mathematical, coalesce and work together. The outcome, 
		I argue, is a different way of thinking about literature: What if we started thinking about literature as a model? Folks in the medical humanities are already doing thinking of literature in this way. What I am suggesting is that this way of thinking about what is literature/
		what literature does begins in the mid-eighteenth century and finds one of its most mature examples in the Romantic-era class, Wordsworth's <strong>Lyrical Ballads</strong>.
