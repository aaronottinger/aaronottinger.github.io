My interdisciplinary research informs the kinds of expository writing classes I teach. In my current writing and rhetoric course, “Mathematizing Human Life,” students explore how mathematical algorithms determine everyday human decisions and how this process has become increasingly opaque with the rise of digital technology. It is a surprising topic, but by the end of the first week students are tying mathematical algorithms to rhetoric and writing. The crucial links in these sequences are the moments I facilitate a space for students to discuss materials, outcomes, approaches, grading, and revising on their own terms. These moments are followed by reflections on how they managed given tasks and how to improve in the future. Students thereby build skills in collaboration, project management, and metacognition, which are essential features of a recursive writing process.
