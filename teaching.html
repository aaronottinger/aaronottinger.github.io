	<h1>Teaching Philosophy</h1>
<div class=content>
	<p>
My teaching is inquiry-based and student-centered. While my classes are peppered with lectures, for the most part students
		can expect to arrive to class with a hands-on activity waiting for them, followed by group discussion and written 
		reflection, often in that order. This process is informed by my research on the history of math, logic, and education.
		Instead of starting with an abstract discussion, students begin with concrete materials, on which our discussion is
		then based. Accordingly, students have a chance to work out problems for themselves (with guidance, of course), followed
		by analysis and philosophical reflection. My classes emphasize formulating questions, thinking about process, 
		discovery, problem solving, creativity, and collaboration. 
	</p>
	<p>
Below, I detail some of my practices and provide 
		samples of course materials. 	</p>

	<h1>Creativity in the Classroom</h1>
<div class=content>
	<p>
My specialization in media/adaptation studies also informs my pedagogical approach. Adaptations 
are a creative way to help students transfer unfamiliar information to familiar contexts. 
In my literature courses, students might adapt a poem from Wordsworthâ€™s Lyrical Ballads 
to a video game platform that blends text, historical context, and analysis, paired with an 
essay that explores how the adaptation opens a new point of access. 
These exercises are also embedded with lessons in 
metacognition. They help students think about how adaptations allow 
thinking to migrate across domains. 
		
I have written on using adaptations in the classroom <a href="https://k-saa.org/ada-lovelace-romantic-from-the-future-adapting-ada/">here</a>.

	<h1>Pedagogical Research and Resources</h1>
<div class=content>
	<p>
	To bring my love of teaching to others, I strive to balance my research agenda with publications on pedagogy.
	Plus, most of my social media interactions are related to classroom materials and practice. I have taken numerous 
	classes on online teaching, including a course at Highline's Summer Institute on accessibility, where I focused on 
	accessible syllabi. At present, I am the School for New and Continuing Studies' acting liaison to the Center for 
		Digital Learning and Innovation, where I assist faculty with their online teaching and make recommendations
		for online teaching across the university.
