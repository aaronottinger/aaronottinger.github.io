	<h1>About</h1>
<div class=content>
	
	
	<p>	
	To a large extent, my research focuses on the intersection of literature and mathematics. I'm particularly curious about the way the 
	relationship between math and literature conditions how we read, and ultimately, how we think and feel.</p>
	
	<p>
	More recently, my interests have turned towards digital culture. I focus on what I call the "global ecodigital divide." 
	This study investigates the long historical connections between technology, systemic racism, and ecological destruction, and it offers 
	multimodal and multimedial projects to help people better understand and resist this ongoing problem.

	<p> 
		My teaching is inquiry-based and student-centered. In addition to face-to-face classes, I also specialize 
		in hybrid and online formats. In all of my classes, I emphasize inquiry, recursive processes, equity, problem solving, accessibility,
		creativity, and collaboration.
