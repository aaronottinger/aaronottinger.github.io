	<p> Welcome to the professional website of Aaron Ottinger. The site is currently 
		undergoing some reconstruction, so please pardon the mess.</p>
	
	<p>	
	For the last decade, my research has focused on the intersection of literature and mathematics. I'm particularly invested in the way the 
	relationship between math and literature conditions how we read, and ultimately, how we think and feel.</p>
	
	<p>
	My latest research project focuses on the "global ecodigital divide." 
	This study examines the long historical connections between technology, systemic racism, and ecological destruction. It also offers 
	multimodal and multimedial projects to help students better understand these connections (and to do something about them!).

		In the classroom, I teach litearture, rhetoric and composition, digtal/media studies, and digital humanities. I am trained to teach online and in person.
