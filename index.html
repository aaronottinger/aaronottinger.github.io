	<p> Welcome to the professional website of Aaron Ottinger. Here I detail my past, current, and upcoming research and teaching. The site is currently 
		undergoing reconstruction, so please pardon the mess.</p>
	
	<p>	
	To a large extent, my research focuses on the intersection of literature and mathematics. I'm particularly curious about the way the 
	relationship between math and literature conditions how we read, and ultimately, how we think and feel.</p>
	
	<p>
	I am also working on a project about the "global ecodigital divide." 
	This study investigates the long historical connections between technology, systemic racism, and ecological destruction. It also offers 
	multimodal and multimedial projects to help students better understand these connections (and to do something about them!).

		research and for a list of publications, please visit 
	<a href="https://aaronottinger.github.io/research.html">this page</a>.
	</p>
	<p> 
		I teach courses in litearture, rhetoric and composition, digtal/media studies, and digital humanities. I am trained to teach online and in person. In all of my classes, I emphasize inquiry, recursive processes, equity, problem solving, accessibility,
		creativity, and collaboration.
