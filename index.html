	<h1>Research Focus</h1>
<div class=content>
	
	<p> 
	I teach in the Department of Digital Technology and Cultures at Seattle University, 
	where I work with new and continuing education students in online and hyrbid formats. I teach Introduction to 
	Digital Culture, the History of Text Technologies, Foundations of Digital Rhetoric, plus a service learning course on 
		Social Justice and Digital Media. I am now developing a course on Digital Culture and Ecology, to be offerred 2020-21.
	</p>
		
	<p>	
		I specialize in the history of literature, mathematics, media, and mind. I am especially interested in the co-evolution human cognitive processes and text technologies. 
		But I do not regard the human brain and consciousness as the center and limit of cognition; instead my 
		work also takes into consideration environmental factors and the body. In addition, I look at texts, not just in terms 
		of words printed on the page, but in terms of their mathematical and logical underpinnings and, on yet another level, their material 
		elements. My current manuscript, "Astral Romanticism," examines the migration of objectivity from the geometrical and divine realm, to the 
		probabilistic and human realm, as represented in literary works from the mid-eighteenth century to the early Victorian period. 
		An additional aim of this study is to parse out the many realisms circulating during this period
		and today, and to answer the question, "How realist was Romanticism?"
