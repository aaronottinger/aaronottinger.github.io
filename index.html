	<p>	
		My research focuses on the co-evolution of human cognitive processes and text technologies. 
		I ground this research in the study of eighteenth- and nineteenth-century British literature and media, 
		largely because this is the era when modern mathematics were being formalized, and it is through literature 
		that these new approaches to being and knowing migrated to a wider reading public. To learn more about my
		and for a list of publications, please visit

	In addition to my research, I am also a dedicated educator working in face-to-face, hybrid, and online formats. 
	At present, I teach in the Department of Digital Technology and Cultures at Seattle University, 
	where I work with new and continuing education students. My classes include Introduction to 
	Digital Culture, the History of Text Technologies, Foundations of Digital Rhetoric, a service 
	learning course on Social Justice and Digital Media, and Multimodal Composition. I also teach
	digital storytelling for SU's UCOR curriculum. Previously, as a part-time Lecturer, and earlier as
	a graduate student, I taught literature and composition/rhetoric classes in the English department at the University 
	of Washingtion (2016-18, 2010-16). And from 2008-2019, I taught first-year writing classes 
	to traditional community college and Running Start (high school) students at Highline College in Des Moines, WA.
