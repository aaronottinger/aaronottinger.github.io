	<p>	
		My research focuses on the co-evolution of human cognitive processes and text technologies. 
		I ground this research in the study of eighteenth- and nineteenth-century British literature and media, 
		largely because this was the era when modern mathematics were being formalized, and it is through literature 
		that these new approaches to knowing and being migrated to a wider reading public. To learn more about my
		research and for a list of publications, please visit 
	<a href="https://aaronottinger.github.io/research.html">this page</a>.
	</p>
		
	<p> 
My teaching is inquiry-based and student-centered. Students can expect to arrive to class with a 
		hands-on activity waiting for them, followed by group discussion and written reflection, often in that order. 
		This process is informed by my research on the history of math, logic, and education. 
		Instead of starting with an abstract discussion, students begin with concrete materials, on which our 
		discussion is then based. Accordingly, students have a chance to work out problems for themselves 
		(with guidance, of course), followed by analysis and philosophical reflection. 
		My classes emphasize formulating questions, thinking about process, discovery, problem solving, 
		creativity, and collaboration.
