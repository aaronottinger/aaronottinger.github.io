	<p>	
		My research focuses on the co-evolution of human cognitive processes and text technologies. 
		I ground this research in the study of eighteenth- and nineteenth-century British literature and media, 
		largely because this was the era when modern mathematics were being formalized, and it is through literature 
		that these new approaches to knowing and being migrated to a wider reading public. </p>

		My teaching is inquiry-based and student-centered. I also specialize 
		in hybrid and online formats, and I currently serve as the New and Continuing Studies liaison to the 
		Center for Digital Learning and Innovation at Seattle U. In this capacity, I assist intructors with their online
		classes and make suggestions to the Center for improving Seattle U's online education more generally. Regardless of 
		the format, my classes emphasize asking questions, recursive processes, discovery, problem solving, 
		creativity, and collaboration.
