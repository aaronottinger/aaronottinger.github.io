	<p>
Is it possible to view the world objectively? What about the human mind? And if everything 
is already determined, then how is change even possible? These are the kinds 
of questions I address in my research, which focuses on the dialogue between psychology and mathematics 
as it appeared in literature, from the end of the seventeenth century to the dawn of the Victorian period. 
While I am fascinated by the historical relationship between mathematics, 
media (especially books & literature), and mind, I also strive to connect these historical links to 
present-day developments in the humanities and the sciences. For instance, I am especially concerned with work 
on machine learning and artificial intelligence and how they can tell us something about the cognitive process
of discovery. Last, I am equally committed to promoting the artistic images that emerge as a result of pursuing 
the "view from nowhere," and critiquing colonialist ideologies that often lie at the heart of the pursuit.
