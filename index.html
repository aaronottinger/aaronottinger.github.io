	<p>
Is it possible to view the world objectively? What about the human mind? And if everything 
is already determined, then how is change even possible? These are the kinds 
of questions I address in my research, which focuses on the dialogue between psychology and mathematics 
as it appeared in literature, from the end of the seventeenth century to the dawn of the Victorian period. 
While I am fascinated by the historical relationship between mathematics, 
media (especially books & literature), and mind, I also strive to connect this historical narrative to 
present-day attempts to ascertain and theorize objective standpoints in the humanities and the sciences. 
In my investigations, I am equally committed to 
promoting the artistic images that emerge as a result of pursuing the "view from nowhere," as well as critiquing 
colonialist ideologies that often lie at the heart of the pursuit.
