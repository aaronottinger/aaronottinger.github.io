		My research focuses on the co-evolution of human cognitive processes and text technologies. 
		I ground this research in the study of eighteenth- and nineteenth-century British fiction and media, 
		largely because this is the era when much of modern mathematics was being formalized and we see the origins
		of mathematical and computer modeling. It is my belief that literature also has a hand
		to play in modeling and that the origins of literary modeling can be traced to the eighteenth-century
		when the new mathematics of analytic geometry, probability, and calculus started migrating to the literary 
		domain.</p> 
		<p>
		Why does all this matter? We're already seeing the ways that video games, VR, and augmented reality offer readers 
		a chance to make ethical decisions and to explore those possibilities in worlds of 
		their own making. In other words, a computer model might show you how a planet's ecosystems are self-regulating,
		or how an economic market behaves, but a literary model provides audiences with a chance to test human decision-making
		and world-making, the two main sections in my monograph. Yet the story is a bit more complicated than that because at the 
		heart of every model is an algorithm. Depending on that algorithm, one could be included, excluded, or trapped in a prison
		house (of language or of logic). At the same time, there may be elements within this model that help us see connections
		between domains, and so, like the breakthrough of non-Euclidean geometry, my work pinpoints those places where authors 
		built a view from nowhere into their models, a unmediated spot that would allow for a breakthroughs in thinking and feeling.

	I teach in the Department of Digital Technology and Cultures at Seattle University, 
	where I work with new and continuing education students in online and hyrbid formats. I teach Introduction to 
	Digital Culture, the History of Text Technologies, Foundations of Digital Rhetoric, a service 
	learning course on Social Justice and Digital Media, and Multimodal Composition. As a part-time Lecturer, and earlier as
	a graduate student, I taught literature and composition/rhetoric classes in the English department at the University 
	of Washingtion (2016-18, 2010-16). And from 2008-2019, I taught first-year composition to traditional community college 
	and Running Start (high school) students at Highline College in Des Moines, WA. 
	On this <a href="https://aaronottinger.github.io/aaronottinger.github.io/teaching.html">page</a> you'll learn more
	about my teaching philosophy, and you can view or download a number of my teaching materials, 
	including syllabi.
