	<h1>Research Focus</h1>
<div class=content>
	<p>
I specialize in literature of the long eighteenth-century, media and adaptation studies, and the history of mathematics. 
		My research outlines the intersection of mind and media, and I am especially interested in the co-evolution human an
		cognition and text technologies. But I do not regard the human brain and consciousness as the center and limit of cognition, and instead my 
		work also takes into consideration environmental factors and the body. In addition, I look at texts, not just in terms 
		of words printed on the page, but in terms of their mathematical and logical underpinnings and, on yet another level, their material 
		elements. My current manuscript, "Astral Romanticism," examines the migration of objectivity from the geometrical and divine realm, to the 
		human and probabilistic realm. I chart this development across disciplines, including literature, mathematics, and philosophy, from the mid-eighteenth 
		century to the early Victorian period. The final aim of this study is to parse out the many realisms circulating during this period
		and today, and to answer the question, how realist was Romanticism? </p>

		At present, I teach in the Department of Digital Technology and Cultures at Seattle University, 
	where I work with new and continuing education students in online and hyrbid formats. I teach Introduction to 
	Digital Culture and the History of Text Technologies. With the assistence of the 
	Center for Digital Learning and Innovation (CDLI) at SeattleU, I am now developing a course on digital culture and 
	the Anthropocene, to be offerred 2020-21.
