	<p> 
	I teach in the Department of Digital Technology and Cultures at Seattle University, 
	where I work with new and continuing education students in online and hyrbid formats. I teach Introduction to 
	Digital Culture, the History of Text Technologies, Foundations of Digital Rhetoric, a service 
	learning course on Social Justice and Digital Media, and Multimodal Composition. As a part-time Lecturer, I have also 
	taught literature and composition/rhetoric classes in the English department at the University of Washingtion. And from 2008-2019,
	I taught first-year composition at Highline College in Des Moines, WA. On this site you'll learn about my teaching 
		philosophy and you can also view or download a number of my teaching materials, including syllabi. 
	</p>
		
	<p>	
		My research focuses on the co-evolution of human cognitive processes and text technologies. I ground this research in the study of eighteenth- and nineteenth-century British fiction and poetry, largely because
		this is the era when much of modern mathematics is being formalized and we start to see the beginnings of computing. In otherwords, 
		the Enlightenment can be regarded as the historical germ of cognizant or semi-autonomous texts.
