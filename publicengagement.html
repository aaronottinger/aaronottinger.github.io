<h1>Blogging and Public Engagement</h1>

	<div class=content>

	<p>
	I write blog posts on academic and non-academic sites largely
		for the purpose of engaging with a wider academic, as well as non-academic, audience.</p> 
	<p>I started writing for the North American Society for Studies in Romanticism Graduate Caucus Blog in 2012. Later, I was 
	selected as a Communications Fellow for the Keats-Shelley Assocaition of America, where my primary responsibility was 
	producing content for our Twitter account. I also interviewed scholars and edited those interviews for the K-SAA Blog. Most of our work 
		was a collaborative effort (to the right, you'll find interviews where I was the lead contact person, but generally, everyone helped
		everyone else on their published works).</p>
	<p>I've continued to write for the Keats-Shelley Association, but most recently I've starting blogging on <i>Medium</i> about 
	my job search, trying to balance the hunt for academic and non-academic jobs, and basically anything related to the profession and 
		academic life. In these posts, I am really trying to address other contingent faculty and prospective graduate students still 
		weighing the pros and cons of an academic career.</p>
	<p>
		Last, I started and continue to curate the Twitter account "Literature and Mathematics" (@mad_mathesis). This account
		directly reflects my research on the co-developing relatinoship between literature and math, but the posts cover 
		all time periods and all geographic areas. This social media account raises awareness among the general public regarding 
		the intersections between two seemingly distant disciplines, and it also aims at bridging the gap between practicing humanists and folks in the sciences, including mathematicians,
		physicists, and computer scientists. </p>
