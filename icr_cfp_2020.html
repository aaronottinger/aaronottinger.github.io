<title>Call For Papers: Digital Romanticism and Romantic Digitality </title>

<body>

<h1>International Conference on Romanticism, "Romantic Confluences," Oct. 22-24, 2020, St. Louis, MO</h1>

<h2><strong>Digital Romanticism, Romantic Digitality</strong></h2>
<p>
This panel seeks papers on the confluence of Romantic-era literature and culture and present-day digital
technology and culture. The gap dividing these two eras serves as a historiographical 
reminder that this narrative is not linear. Indeed, the “geology of media,” as Jussi Parikka 
calls it (2015), lays bare the fact that nature and culture/media do not adhere to neatly parallel
lines, leading towards either dystopia or utopia. So historically, participants are encouraged to 
explore the confluence between Romanticism and the digital age, rather than treat them as 
divorced events, separated by a step-by-step sequence.  
</p>
<p>
Theoretically, participants are invited to think Romanticism digitally and/or to think of the 
digital romantically. Such inquiries might examine digital media, technics, or humanities 
through a Romantic-era lens (e.g. Wickman 2016). Or conversely, they might examine 
Romanticism through our current digital tools and networks (e.g. Whitson and Whittaker 2013). 
In either case, participants are encouraged, in a somewhat romantic spirit, to meditate on 
digitality and to think beyond or against it (Galloway 2014).
