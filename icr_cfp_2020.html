<title>Call For Papers: Digital Romanticism and Romantic Digitality </title>
</head>
<body>

<h1>International Conference on Romanticism, "Romantic Confluences," October 22-24 in St. Louis, MO</h1>

<p><strong>Digital Romanticism, Romantic Digitality</strong></p>
<p>
This panel seeks papers on the confluence of Romantic-era literature and culture and present-day 
technology and culture. The gap separating these two eras serves as a historiographical 
reminder that this narrative is not linear, and that the “geology of media,” as Jussi Parikka 
calls it (2015), lays bare the fact that nature and culture/media do not adhere to neatly parallel
 lines, leading towards dystopia, utopia, some combination of these, or perhaps a “limited” version, 
 to borrow from Anahid Nersessian (2015). So historically, participants are encouraged to 
 explore the confluence between Romanticism and the digital age, rather than treat them as 
 divorced events, separated by a linear, step-by-step sequence.  
</p>
<p>
Theoretically, participants are invited to think Romanticism digitally and/or to think of the 
digital romantically. Such inquiries might examine digital media, technics, or humanities 
through a Romantic-era lens (e.g. Wickman 2016). Or conversely, they might examine 
Romanticism through our current digital tools and networks (e.g. Whitson and Whittaker 2013). 
In either case, participants are encouraged, in a somewhat romantic spirit, to meditate on 
digitality and to think beyond or against it (Galloway 2014).
