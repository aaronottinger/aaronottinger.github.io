**Office:** By Appointment

## Course Description

In “Social Justice and Digital Media” you will learn skills that will help you take theories of social justice in the digital realm and apply them outside the confines of the university. This course is a service-learning class, which means we will work in partnership with an outside mission-based organization and the work you do will directly impact the community in which you live. 

Along this journey, we will be asking important questions about social justice work: Who gets to do it? How it is done? and Who benefits? It’s important that we take a critical approach because it is easy to do social justice work irresponsibly. For instance, if you encountered a community that lacked educational supplies, it might seem like a good idea to send them laptops and tablets. But if the internet infrastructure is weak, how effective are these new tools going to be? Part of our job in this class is to think about our own position within a social justice framework and to imagine community-led approaches. In part, that means asking communities what they want instead of telling them what they need. Instead of a top-down model, we are thinking through more dynamic approaches to social justice. 

While we will consider the rhetorical and epistemological consequences of our approaches and products, we will tie rhetorical and epistemic questions (How are we persuaded of x? and How do we know x?) to issues of usability and accessibility. For instance, we might look at how a color combination covers up information on a website for colorblind users, and thus that information would essentially not exist for that particular audience. So, from an epistemic point of view, it is much more difficult to know something that you cannot physically access. To address these issues, the project in this class will focus especially on building user experience (UX) skills in design, writing, research, and testing. 

Working with the local organization EchoX.org, we will function much like a nonprofit consulting company. Our mission is to aid this social justice-oriented organization by drafting a proposal, conducting UX research and testing for their website, interpreting analytics, constructing recommended changes (if any apply), and creating a presentation. Specifically, we have been tasked with assessing the usability of the site’s directory, which helps visitors find like-minded organizations that serve marginalized communities. Our findings, ultimately, will contribute to the board’s decision to allocate more funds to developing the directory, or saving that money for other priorities. Our work here will ultimately contribute to a larger whole, where more resources and information are available to those who are routinely underrepresented and underserved in and outside of the digital domain. 

## Aims of the Course

•	Apply critical and theoretical lenses to specific technologies, cultures, and historic moments.
•	Articulate the possibilities and limits of emergent digital technologies and digitally mediated spaces to disrupt dominant, colonialist powers and to build more equitable spaces.
•	Build and participate in an e-service learning project focused on social justice.
•	Reflect upon one’s goals for enacting social justice and ethical action.

## Learning Outcomes 

The Learning Outcomes for this class are the same as the course outcomes for the department. However, to make sense of these outcomes in the context of a Digital Identities, each outcome will require a little qualification (below). In addition, every assignment in this course corresponds with one or more Learning Outcome. In each module/assignment, the corresponding Learning Outcomes will be qualified further to fit the task at hand.

I	EXPLAIN KEY CONCEPTS IN COMPUTING: This outcome focuses your ability to explain key concepts in computing, media production, and internet-enabled communication.

Throughout the term, there will be key concepts introduced, pertaining to social justice and digital media (e.g. “accessibility”). Students may be asked to define and engage with new concepts in quizzes and discussions. In addition, students will be expected negotiate the use of this vocabulary when interacting with audiences outside the classroom or with other professionals working outside of our selected skillset (i.e. user experience/usability).  
 
II	EVALUATE RESEARCH SOURCES & DIGITAL TOOLS: This outcome focuses on your ability to evaluate the relative strengths and weaknesses of research sources, digital tools, interfaces, and technologies. 

Students will encounter a number of critics and theorists throughout the term, and will have opportunities to compare, contrast, and synthesize these theories and outlooks. In addition, students will have the opportunity to evaluate technologies and their ability to enhance, amplify, filter, distort, include, exclude, and target human subjects and identities. 
 
III	ANALYZE TECHNOLOGY USING INTERDISCIPLINARY THEORIES & METHODS: This outcome focuses on your ability to analyze new and emerging media using interdisciplinary theories and methods. 

Students will analyze digital technologies using frameworks provided by a variety of theorists and critics. Students will also employ a variety of frameworks from critical race theory to science, technology, and society (STS) studies. 
 
IV	EXAMINE TECHNOLOGICALLY MEDIATED IDENTITIES: This outcome focuses on your ability to examine how technology changes sense of self and transforms ideologies of gender, nationality, ethnicity, sexuality, and social class. 

Much like Digital Identities (DICE4010), one of the fundamental questions of this class is: Who is included and excluded in the world of digital culture? But in this class, we will use digital technology to actually create a more inclusive digital culture. The question now is how will our efforts enhance, amplify, or alter the identities of our intended (and unintended) audiences? 
 
V	DESIGN MULTIMODAL PROJECTS: This outcome focuses on your ability to design socially responsible multimodal projects using digital rhetoric and audience engagement strategies. 

The Final Project for DICE4040 is a report and presentation for the community partner. This project will be a collaborative effort and the final result will involve a variety of modalities, media, genres that contribute to an overall narrative that is legible to a wider, non-academic audience. 
 
VI	REFLECTION: This outcome focuses on your ability to reflect upon your own work, roles, values, and identities related to digital culture and engagement with social justice issues.

The term will be punctuated by reflective writing. Rather than ask students to wait until the end of the course to share their personal thoughts and feelings, reflections will be incorporated into each module.

### Preparing for the ePortfolio & Capstone Course

Students are encouraged to think about how various assignments fulfill the aforementioned Learning Outcomes.
All assignments should be saved for the final portfolio.
It is strongly recommended that students have more than one backup of every major assignment.

## Materials
Students will read an array of source in this class but two books in particular will guide us: 

Costanza-Chock, Sasha. Design Justice: Community-led Practices to Build the Worlds We Need. Cambridge, Massachusetts: MIT, 2020.

Constanza-Chock’s new book will help us think theoretically and contextually about how design work is also social justice work, and it will aid us in our efforts to think critically about our own position within a dominant matrix. 

Krug, Steve. Don't Make Me Think, Revisited: A Common Sense Approach to Web Usability, Third Edition. New Riders, 2013.

Krug’s book is a classic in usability studies and its many lessons remain true. This text will serve as our introduction to the world of UX. 

NB: For several of the texts in this class, students will need either Safari (preferred) or Google Chrome. Unfortunately, Krug’s book and others will not work on Firefox or other browsers. 


## Communication

### Face-to-Face

I am available meet "face-to-face" online via Zoom meetings. We will have face-to-face classes every other week and individual (one-on-one) conferences twice during the term, once early on and once towards the end. These meetings will be conducted via Zoom.

### Email

Please email me any questions you have at any time. I recommend using the Canvas email tool ("Inbox" located on the far-left navigation bar). But you are welcome to email me directly through the seattleu email system (Outlook).
While you may email me at any hour, I am more likely to respond to student emails from 9am-6pm, Monday through Friday. I will check email less frequently after 6pm. On the weekends, I will do my best to check and respond to email but that is also time for me to get away from the office and unplug. So beware: if you want to make sure your questions are answered, get them in before the end of the workday on Friday.
Please allow 24 hours for responses.

### Slack

This class will use a private Slack channel (in addition to the department’s #general channel). In keeping with industry standards, it’s important that we have a communication platform to foster a collaborative environment. #4040_20FQ will be available for students and the instructor. You will receive an invitation before the start of class, and students are encouraged to use this outlet. 

### Twitter

I love Twitter (@AaronOttinger). I often post things that I think will be interesting for students using the hashtag #DICE4040. Nothing I post here is required and I will likely cross-post on Slack. The great thing about Twitter is that we can connect with other working professionals that might be able to help us in our discussions. Feel free to engage with me on this platform as well.



## Required Tools and Software

It is recommended that you start by watching the CDLI's [Student Orientation to Distance Learning](https://www.seattleu.edu/cdli/instructional-continuity/student-orientation/).

This course will be fully online, therefore you will need access to an up-to-date device that is capable of playing videos, recording videos and using a camera. If your computer is capable of playing multimedia but doesn't have a webcam, you may be able to use your mobile device to record and upload videos. 

It is essential that you have a reliable broadband network connection available during the course. We recommend cable broadband, DSL, or for mobile devices, availability of LTE. Use of satellite broadband services or WIMAX services such as Clear may not have sufficient bandwidth to allow successful participation in this course. If you can watch Netflix or YouTube videos on high definition without lags, it is likely your broadband connection is sufficient. You should also be aware that some countries block content, such as YouTube videos. If you will be traveling to a country that may block content, please talk to me right away.

### Software

Most of this course will take place within the learning management system Canvas. For their final project, students will also have the opportunity to work with the R programming environment. We will download R in the early weeks of the course to address any issues before the software is required for the course. 

## Community Agreements

To be created in the first week of class

## Diversity, Growth, and Future Application

I recognize and respect the diversity of races, genders, sexual identities, classes, ages, and abilities. Differences provide us with opportunities to learn new things, compare experiences, understand ourselves better, and find common ground. Differences also sometimes engender conflict. In the midst of that conflict, I ask everyone to maintain a language and an attitude of respect.
Bear in mind that some opinions and materials in this class might challenge our personal views and beliefs. But if the goal in this class is to grow cognitively and emotionally, students and the instructor are expected to question the limitations of our personal histories to make room for the personal views and experiences of others.

Last, consider that the path to emotional and intellectual growth may not be won by challenging one’s own personal beliefs and values only. To embrace new ideas, skills, and values for future use in different contexts, we must also conduct personal investigations that ask why our views are being challenged in the first place. Accordingly, it is always worth asking “Why do I feel x?”, “Why do I believe x?”, and “Why do I value x?” Ultimately, this course is not solely intended to increase our knowledge about a list of terms; more importantly, the task is to alter the fundamental ways in which we understand ourselves and our relationship to ourselves and others within a digital culture.

## Self-Care and Caring for One Another

This classroom is a place where everyone is welcome and should feel like they matter. Everyone is encouraged to advocate for themselves. Here are some items to consider:     

1.	Move if you need to: You know your body best.

If you need to get up, sit down, go to the bathroom, and so forth, please do so. You do not need permission.     

2.	Stay home if you need to:

A little less applicable in an online class, it's still important to let the instructor know if you cannot attend an online meeting. You are encouraged to email the instructor ahead of time, but you do not have to reveal why. Simply stating that you are not well is enough. But if you feel like you need to explain, you are also invited to do so.     

3.	Eat/drink if you need to:

If you need to eat or drink in class, please do so. But please try to avoid foods that are going to disrupt your neighbor’s learning. Really pungent or noisy foods might best be saved for the cafeteria. Also, be mindful of spaces (like computer labs) where food is not allowed. Feel free to take a break from these spaces if you need food or drink.      

4.	Speak up, slow down, repeat, stop:

During lectures and discussions, we may need things said again or slowed down. You are encouraged to ask.     
5.	Be aware of your classmates’ feelings:
If someone looks like they are not doing well, ask them, “Are you okay?” Let’s not ignore one another. Let’s not let anyone go unnoticed—unless, of course, someone expresses that they would like to be left alone. Then leave them alone.

6.	In light of the COVID-19: Stay home, wear a mask when you’re out, wash your hands frequently, and don't touch your face:

While we are trying to proceed as noraml (haha), there is nothing normal about a pandemic, and everyone is encouraged to follow state guidelines and to take necessary precautions. If you become sick or a family member is sick, or you suffer from the death of a loved one, everyone is encouraged to share this information. Of course, we will respect your privacy. But the only way we will manage this pandemic is through mutual support. Please visit Seattle University’s COVID-19 Response page for more information.

### Incomplete Grades

If you are unable to complete course requirements because of extenuating circumstances, please notify the instructor on or before the date the assignment is due and provide relevant supporting documentation (e.g. doctor’s note, note from counselor).

An agreement to receive an Incomplete (I) grade may be negotiated if your circumstances do not allow you to finish the course on time. The Incomplete Removal Policy of the university is available on the Office of the [Registrar web site](https://www.seattleu.edu/registrar/Policies.aspx). 


## Course Policies


### Assignment Deadlines and Extensions

Assignments should be submitted at the designated due date/time. If a student requies an extension, they should request one from the instructor 24 hours in advance. 

#### Extended Extensions

All assignments from the first four weeks of the quarter will be due no later than the start of week 5. This hard deadline is automatic. Exceptions will require additional permission.

All assignments from the second four weeks of the quarter will be due no later than the start of week 9. This hard deadline is automatic. Exceptions will require additional permission.


## Assignments and Grading


#### CONFERENCES (2.5 points ea. / 5% total)

Each student will meet with the instructor twice for online, one-on-one conferences. These conferences will take place between weeks 2 & 3 and weeks 7 & 8.

#### DISCUSSIONS (10 points ea. / 20% total)

Each week will be a discussion question for you to explore. These should be 150+ words and will be due by midnight Saturday of each week. I would like you to then comment on two of your peer’s postings by midnight on Sunday. We will discuss these in class during the next in class meeting.

#### PROGRESS REPORTS (10 points each/ 10%)

Students will be asked to submit a progress report every other week (4 total) with respect to their particular task(s) or job for the FINAL PROJECT. These can be short reports that simply detail what you have accomplished (or attempted to accomplish) in the last week or so. In each case, students will be asked to provide some kind of evidence for their progress. In many cases, this evidence can be a screenshot of something you’re doing on your computer (it must be legible). In addition, students will be asked to submit how many hours they have spent working on the project, so it is highly recommended that students maintain a log of their hours. 

Progress reports are important because you will have to account for your contribution to the FINAL PROJECT at the end of the class. These reports will help you to make a case for your contribution. 

#### Quizzes (5-20 points each / 10%)

Normally our classes avoid quizzes, but because DICE4040 includes many skills acquisition lessons, perhaps the most effective way to test these skills is through short quizzes. These are not meant to “stump” students. While there might be the occasional multiple-choice question, these quizzes are really intended to get students thinking with and applying the skills lessons, so you are more likely to be asked to sketch a design, outline a model, or create a chart. 

#### FINAL PROJECT (up to 300 points / 40%)

The Final Project will be a collaborative effort. It will include a proposal (first draft and final draft), usability testing questions and revisions, testing, the interpretation of data, project recommendations, the final deliverable (i.e. a report, wireframes, prototypes, and so forth), the presentation to the community partner, and a final summary of your contribution, which will be similar to a typical progress report. Many of these assignments will be submitted on discussion boards, but they will be labeled as “FINAL PROJECT.” Students will all receive the same grade for the final deliverable and the group presentation; for everything else they will receive an individual score. The final project will conclude with an email to the community partner, which will thank them for the opportunity and provide access to deliverables (a link or compressed file). 

#### REFLECTIONS (10 points each / 15% total)

Following different weeks and sections, we will submit reflective essays. At 15% of your grade, these reflections are very important. They should demonstrate an understanding of the outcomes fulfilled. Additionally, students will reflect on how the skills acquired in class will apply outside of class. Last, and most important, students can use these reflections to discuss how they feel about their research, their findings, and how it all relates to their world and the world at large. Students are encouraged here to make connections, to course materials, to previous or simultaneous classes, as well as current events. 

### Grade Scale (screen reader friendly)

| Grade Percentage | GPA | Letter Grade |
| ----------- | ----------- | ----------- |
| between 93 and 100 |between 3.8 and 4.0 | A | 
| between 89 and 92 | between 3.4 and 3.7 | A minus | 
| between 86 and 88 | between 3.1 and 3.3 | B plus | 
| between 83 and 85 | between 2.8 and 3.0 | B | 
| between 79 and 82 | between 2.4 and 2.7 | B minus | 
| between 76 and 78 | between 2.1 and 2.3 | C plus | 
| between 70 and 73 | between 1.8 and 2.0 | C | 
| between 65 and 68 | between 1.4 and 1.7 | C minus | 
| between 62 and 64 | between 1.1 and 1.3 | D plus | 
| between 60 and 61 | between 0.8 and 1.0 | D | 
| between 58 and 59 | between 0.1 and 0.7 | D minus | 
| between 0 and 57 | 0.0 | F | 

# Course Schedule

Please note that the following is a ‘working schedule.’ Class materials are subject to change based on the interests, understanding, and general pace of the class.  Changes and announcements will be made in class and through email and Announcements (on Canvas).

## Week 1: What is Social Justice and Digital Media All About? (Lab, Jan 7)

This week is dedicated to understanding the fundamental concepts on which this class is based. We will think about what it means to combine digital technology/media with social justice. Next, we will discuss what it means to do service learning in the classroom, or what it means to take the classroom beyond the university walls and into “real life.” But, with this traversing of borders in mind, we also have to recognize our privileged position within the university system, and so we will explore what it means to colonize others in ways that are consistent with imperialism, capitalism, and neoliberalism, and what it might mean to take a decolonizing approach instead. 

For the final project, we will just explore the community partner’s site in depth, and familiarize ourselves with their problem, purpose, audience, medium, and genre.

## WEEK 2: Problems and Purposes (Class, Jan 14)

You wouldn’t want a doctor to start operating on you before diagnosing the problem. Same in the world of digital culture. But like a doctor, once we identify a problem and start addressing it (our purpose), we may find additional problems that we did not anticipate. That’s fine. It’s still preferable to have a problem in mind while also maintaining an openness to the possibility of other, unforeseen problems as well. 

Last week we looked at our community partner’s website. Now let’s compare it to other sites that have a similar problem and purpose. What do we like more about these sites? What issues do we find that we want to avoid?

## WEEK 3: Who We Are and Who Gets to Be: Authors/Activists/Designers (Lab, Jan 21)

In any rhetorical situation, we want to think about the author, the text, and the audience. Problems and purposes belong to the author (week 2). In addition, we also need to think about our identity as authors/designers. Consider that for thousands of years, organizations and entire states have oppressed women and excluded them from education. So, when a man steps in to “explain” something to a woman, there is a whole history of oppression compressed in that act, and thereby it is no surprise that the explanation is unwelcomed. Likewise, we need to ask ourselves, as college students (even nontraditional), what history and meaning might be associated with us in the eyes of our audiences? This week we will turn a critical eye on ourselves. 

This week also need to draft a proposal regarding our project for our community partner. We will model our proposal on professional UX proposals.

WEEK 4: Audiences and Affordances (Jan 28)

We know from studying digital media and globalization (DICE4020) that many corporations swoop in after a natural or economic disaster and use a community’s vulnerability to their advantage, an important component of “the shock doctrine.” The question is: Where were these companies before the disaster? If you’re only there to help when someone is at “rock bottom,” are you really there to help, or are you preying on someone at their most vulnerable moment? These kinds of questions belong to rhetoric, and this week we will think rhetorically about the people we wish to serve, when is the right time to offer services (and for how long), how should we serve (what media should we use, what are appropriate genres, what are the most useful and socially responsible tools or software), what are we convincing others (and ourselves) of, and ultimately, why are we doing it? 

UX testing requires that we have test subjects, and those test subjects need direction. This direction comes in the form of a series of questions, which we will start to develop this week.

WEEK 5: Tools, Sites, Media, and Modalities (Feb 4)

If you wanted to present information to a group of elementary school students, you might be less successfully if you show up with a bunch of graphs, charts, and statistical figures to back up your claims (instead, consider puppets!). This is an issue of audience and knowing which modalities, generic conventions, and media will be received best by them. This week we consider the rhetoric and the epistemological significance of the tools, sites, media, and modalities (visual, spatial, linguistic, oral, and so forth) we use in social justice work in a digital domain. 

We also need to decide what tools we want to use in our own UX project. We will survey the tools available to us, and think about the media and modalities we want to use to present our findings from these tools.

WEEK 6: Accessibility, part I: Definition, History, and Legality (Feb 11)

One of the most important lessons from Eve Kosofsky Sedgwick, Judith Butler, and their ilk is this: No body is the same. Usually when we make something, we make it according to our own body. So if I make a table, I make it according to my height. But not everyone is the same height as me. Is it possible to make other tables? Is it possible to make an adjustable table? Similar situations can be found online. This week, we think about what accessibility means, how we have arrived at our current levels of accessibility, and the legal concerns tied to accessibility. 

This week we begin our testing. First, we have to recruit some test subjects. We will also want to make sure that we are including accessibility issues within this testing, so we may have to go back and revise our usability questions before getting started.

PROGRESS REPORT: Week 6



WEEK 7: Accessibility, part II: Research, Testing, Design (Feb 18)

Now that we have situated accessibility within a larger history, now we need to think about how we can incorporate it into our designs. For instance, the syllabus you are currently reading has been organized using headings (h1, h2, h3, h4). These headings make it easier to navigate for someone using a screen reader. While this simple fix will not eliminate all accessibility issues, we must strive to constantly improve our online documents, tools, and sites so that they can accommodate as many folks as possible. 

This week, we may still be scheduling and running UX testing sessions. That’s fine. Hopefully, the data is starting to pour in and we can start thinking about how to organize this data, what it means, and how we want to re-present it to others.

FINAL PROJECT: Analyzing Data and Interpreting the Results 

Module 3: Deliverables, Presentations, and Reflections

WEEK 8: Deliverables and Proposal Revisions (Feb 25)

By now we should have all of our data and we should no longer be running usability tests. Based on the data we have at this point, what changes, if any, do we think our client should make to their site? Can we design something that helps them imagine what an alternative might look like? Last, do we need to make any revisions to our proposal? Did we run tests that we did not originally recommend? Are we fulfilling our goals/outcomes? Let’s adjust the proposal so that it reflects what we are actually doing and what we’re actually going to accomplish.

WEEK 9: Social Justice as a Framework for Presenting (Mar 4)

Isn’t a presentation just a presentation? Your presentation can’t be informed by social justice, can it? It can! This week, will read a number of shorter pieces from academics working on racial justice and disability justice, and think about how we can apply their principles and recommendations into our own presentation for our community partner.

WEEK 10: Reflections (Mar 11)

This week we present our findings to our community partner. Hooray! You’ve made it. But we also want to think about the future of social justice and digital media, and what role they might play in our own lives following the conclusion of our class.
