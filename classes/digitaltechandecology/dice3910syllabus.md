# DICE 3910: Digital Cultures and Ecology

 
**Spring 2021**

**Online:** Asynchronous

**Instructor:** Dr. Aaron Ottinger

**Office:** By Appointment

## Course Description

This transdisciplinary (“creating a unity of intellectual frameworks beyond the disciplinary perspectives”) course investigates the relationship between digital culture, technology, and the environment or ecological systems. The title of this course could take a number of forms, from “Technology and Nature” to “The History and Future of Digital and Environmental Relations.” In other words, our scope is large. To make things a little more complicated, as we explore the historical relationships between technology and the environment, we will also consider the parallel historical development of “the human” and the many humanisms, including definitions and illustrations of the relationships between the posthuman, inhuman, and nonhuman. While this scope may now seem too large, it reflects the complicated web of our subject matter, and follows the approach outlined by scholars in ecocriticism, Black studies, and media studies, our primary frameworks, and represented by Donna Haraway, Katherine McKittrick, and Jussi Parikka, respectively, among others. 

To manage the breadth of our study, it is divided into three parts, which correspond with the past, present, and future. Our story begins with the Black Atlantic, or the Atlantic slave trade, for it represents not only the dawn of Modernity (Gilroy), as this class argues it also represents the meeting point of math+economics+technology, exploited labor, and ecological destruction all in the name of “the ultimate cause-that-is-not-a-subject: capitalism” (Fisher). The middle of our class will focus on the recent past our and our present moment, taking the global construction of the smartphone as our test case. The final module looks at some clues from the present and considers storytelling tools for speculating about, hopefully, a more equitable and hospitable future. 

In correspondence with these three modules, we will have three major assignments. The first module is a traditional, college-level essay. The second will include designing an advertisement for a present-day tech company and a rhetorical defense of your work. The final project is a more strictly creative endeavor: students will be asked with creating a digital, multimodal, multimedial, and multispecies artwork that outlines a more just and sustainable future. 

By the end of this class, students will have familiarity with a number of ways that digital technology and cultures intersect with ecology, from exploited land and labor for raw resources to the carbon footprint of data storage. We will explore these intersections through analyses of representations (personal narratives, advertisements, and artworks) as well as through engagements with the people affected and the raw materials themselves. Students will also have a firmer understanding about how this history of digital technology and ecological destruction can be mapped onto the development of various humanisms. Along these same lines, students will leave with a clear narrative, illustrating how this story is steeped in historical and material conditions and how this story might change in the future. 


## Acknowledgements 

>I am deeply in debt to Jayme Jacobson in SU's Center for Digital Learning and Innovation. She was there to show me the way when I started designing this as an online class in 2019. She deserves a lot of the credit for the good parts. The mistakes are all mine. I also want to thank the DICE's liaison at the SU Lemieux Library, Reilly Curran. Without her we would not be reading the latest and sharpest texts. 

## Learning Outcomes 

The Learning Outcomes for this class are the same as the course outcomes for the department. However, to make sense of these outcomes in the context of a social justice and digital media, each outcome will require a little qualification (below). In addition, every assignment in this course corresponds with one or more Learning Outcome. In each module/assignment, the corresponding Learning Outcomes will be qualified further to fit the task at hand.

### I	EXPLAIN KEY CONCEPTS IN COMPUTING: This outcome focuses your ability to explain key concepts in computing, media production, and internet-enabled communication.

Throughout the term, there will be key concepts introduced, pertaining to social justice and digital media (e.g. “accessibility”). Students may be asked to define and engage with new concepts in quizzes and discussions. In addition, students will be expected negotiate the use of this vocabulary when interacting with audiences outside the classroom or with other professionals working outside of our selected skillset (i.e. user experience/usability).  
 
### II	EVALUATE RESEARCH SOURCES & DIGITAL TOOLS: This outcome focuses on your ability to evaluate the relative strengths and weaknesses of research sources, digital tools, interfaces, and technologies. 

Students will encounter a number of critics and theorists throughout the term, and will have opportunities to compare, contrast, and synthesize these theories and outlooks. In addition, students will have the opportunity to evaluate technologies and their ability to enhance, amplify, filter, distort, include, exclude, and target human subjects and identities. 
 
### III	ANALYZE TECHNOLOGY USING INTERDISCIPLINARY THEORIES & METHODS: This outcome focuses on your ability to analyze new and emerging media using interdisciplinary theories and methods. 

Students will analyze digital technologies using frameworks provided by a variety of theorists and critics. Students will also employ a variety of frameworks from critical race theory to science, technology, and society (STS) studies. 
 
### IV	EXAMINE TECHNOLOGICALLY MEDIATED IDENTITIES: This outcome focuses on your ability to examine how technology changes sense of self and transforms ideologies of gender, nationality, ethnicity, sexuality, and social class. 

Much like Digital Identities (DICE4010), one of the fundamental questions of this class is: Who is included and excluded in the world of digital culture? But in this class, we will use digital technology to actually create a more inclusive digital culture. The question now is how will our efforts enhance, amplify, or alter the identities of our intended (and unintended) audiences? 
 
### V	DESIGN MULTIMODAL PROJECTS: This outcome focuses on your ability to design socially responsible multimodal projects using digital rhetoric and audience engagement strategies. 

The Final Project for DICE4040 is a report and presentation for the community partner. This project will be a collaborative effort and the final result will involve a variety of modalities, media, and genres that contribute to an overall narrative, legible to a wider, non-academic audience. 
 
### VI	REFLECTION: This outcome focuses on your ability to reflect upon your own work, roles, values, and identities related to digital culture and engagement with social justice issues.

The term will be punctuated by reflective writing. Rather than ask students to wait until the end of the course to share their personal thoughts and feelings, reflections will be incorporated into each module.

### Preparing for the ePortfolio & Capstone Course

Students are encouraged to think about how various assignments fulfill the aforementioned Learning Outcomes.
All assignments should be saved for the final portfolio.
It is strongly recommended that students have more than one backup of every major assignment.

## Materials
Students will read an array of source in this class but two books in particular will guide us: 

Costanza-Chock, Sasha. Design Justice: Community-led Practices to Build the Worlds We Need. Cambridge, Massachusetts: MIT, 2020.

Constanza-Chock’s new book will help us think theoretically and contextually about how design work is also social justice work, and it will aid us in our efforts to think critically about our own position within a dominant matrix. 

Krug, Steve. Don't Make Me Think, Revisited: A Common Sense Approach to Web Usability, Third Edition. New Riders, 2013.

Krug’s book is a classic in usability studies and its many lessons remain true. This text will serve as our introduction to the world of UX. 

NB: For several of the texts in this class, students will need either Safari (preferred) or Google Chrome. Unfortunately, Krug’s book and others will not work on Firefox or other browsers. 


## Communication

### Face-to-Face

I am available to meet "face-to-face" online via Zoom meetings. We will have face-to-face classes every other week and individual (one-on-one) conferences twice during the term, once early on and once towards the end. These meetings will be conducted via Zoom.

### Email

Please email me any questions you have at any time. I recommend using the Canvas email tool ("Inbox" located on the far-left navigation bar). But you are welcome to email me directly through the seattleu email system (Outlook).
While you may email me at any hour, I am more likely to respond to student emails from 9am-6pm, Monday through Friday. I will check email less frequently after 6pm. On the weekends, I will do my best to check and respond to email but that is also time for me to get away from the office and unplug. So beware: if you want to make sure your questions are answered, get them in before the end of the workday on Friday.
Please allow 24 hours for responses.

### Twitter

I love Twitter (@AaronOttinger). I often post things that I think will be interesting for students using the hashtag #DICE4040. Nothing I post here is required and I will likely cross-post on Slack. The great thing about Twitter is that we can connect with other working professionals that might be able to help us in our discussions. Feel free to engage with me on this platform as well.



## Required Tools and Software

It is recommended that you start by watching the CDLI's [Student Orientation to Distance Learning](https://www.seattleu.edu/cdli/instructional-continuity/student-orientation/).

This course will be fully online, therefore you will need access to an up-to-date device that is capable of playing videos, recording videos and using a camera. If your computer is capable of playing multimedia but doesn't have a webcam, you may be able to use your mobile device to record and upload videos. 

It is essential that you have a reliable broadband network connection available during the course. We recommend cable broadband, DSL, or for mobile devices, availability of LTE. Use of satellite broadband services or WIMAX services such as Clear may not have sufficient bandwidth to allow successful participation in this course. If you can watch Netflix or YouTube videos on high definition without lags, it is likely your broadband connection is sufficient. You should also be aware that some countries block content, such as YouTube videos. If you will be traveling to a country that may block content, please talk to me right away.

### Software

Most of this course will take place within the learning management system Canvas. For their final project, students will also have the opportunity to work with the R programming environment. We will download R in the early weeks of the course to address any issues before the software is required for the course. 

## Community Agreements (written and ratified by the class as a whole)

Set reasonable goals.  Working out a timeline for completion together will ensure we are all aware of our commitments to the group and are able to meet them.

Construct workload/project goals in a way that gives everyone some wiggle room if we need to negotiate the work loads between folks (sort of cushion so to speak).

Be honest with each other about your problems/issues - or - if you need help, ask for it. We all have really busy lives and things may come up that we can't account for and we should be able to reach out for help if we need it and know that there's a supportive structure in place. 

Show up on time to meetings and keep to the schedule; if the meeting is one hour, keep the discussion on topic and moving forward. 

Flexibility: everyone has a different level of skills so some people may prefer to work on certain things more than others.

Patience: putting an effort into having patience with each other will pay off in the end. 

Be open about the ideas of others: If an idea or thought about changing something doesn't work for the group, try not to diminish the idea itself and instead work to come up with an alternative.   

## Diversity, Growth, and Future Application

I recognize and respect the diversity of races, genders, sexual identities, classes, ages, and abilities. Differences provide us with opportunities to learn new things, compare experiences, understand ourselves better, and find common ground. Differences also sometimes engender conflict. In the midst of that conflict, I ask everyone to maintain a language and an attitude of respect.
Bear in mind that some opinions and materials in this class might challenge our personal views and beliefs. But if the goal in this class is to grow cognitively and emotionally, students and the instructor are expected to question the limitations of our personal histories to make room for the personal views and experiences of others.

Last, consider that the path to emotional and intellectual growth may not be won by challenging one’s own personal beliefs and values only. To embrace new ideas, skills, and values for future use in different contexts, we must also conduct personal investigations that ask why our views are being challenged in the first place. Accordingly, it is always worth asking “Why do I feel x?”, “Why do I believe x?”, and “Why do I value x?” Ultimately, this course is not solely intended to increase our knowledge about a list of terms; more importantly, the task is to alter the fundamental ways in which we understand ourselves and our relationship to ourselves and others within a digital culture.

## Self-Care and Caring for One Another

This classroom is a place where everyone is welcome and should feel like they matter. Everyone is encouraged to advocate for themselves. Here are some items to consider:     

1.	Move if you need to: You know your body best.

If you need to get up, sit down, go to the bathroom, and so forth, please do so. You do not need permission.     

2.	Stay home if you need to:

A little less applicable in an online class, it's still important to let the instructor know if you cannot attend an online meeting. You are encouraged to email the instructor ahead of time, but you do not have to reveal why. Simply stating that you are not well is enough. But if you feel like you need to explain, you are also invited to do so.     

3.	Eat/drink if you need to:

If you need to eat or drink in class, please do so. But please try to avoid foods that are going to disrupt your neighbor’s learning. Really pungent or noisy foods might best be saved for the cafeteria. Also, be mindful of spaces (like computer labs) where food is not allowed. Feel free to take a break from these spaces if you need food or drink.      

4.	Speak up, slow down, repeat, stop:

During lectures and discussions, we may need things said again or slowed down. You are encouraged to ask.     
5.	Be aware of your classmates’ feelings:
If someone looks like they are not doing well, ask them, “Are you okay?” Let’s not ignore one another. Let’s not let anyone go unnoticed—unless, of course, someone expresses that they would like to be left alone. Then leave them alone.

6.	In light of the COVID-19: Stay home, wear a mask when you’re out, wash your hands frequently, and don't touch your face:

While we are trying to proceed as noraml (haha), there is nothing normal about a pandemic, and everyone is encouraged to follow state guidelines and to take necessary precautions. If you become sick or a family member is sick, or you suffer from the death of a loved one, everyone is encouraged to share this information. Of course, we will respect your privacy. But the only way we will manage this pandemic is through mutual support. [Please visit Seattle University’s COVID-19 Response page for more information](https://www.seattleu.edu/coronavirus/).

## Course Policies


### Assignment Deadlines and Extensions

Assignments should be submitted at the designated due date/time. If a student requies an extension, they should request one from the instructor 24 hours in advance. 

#### Extended Extensions

All assignments from the first four weeks of the quarter will be due no later than the start of week 5. This hard deadline is automatic. Exceptions will require additional permission.

All assignments from the second four weeks of the quarter will be due no later than the start of week 9. This hard deadline is automatic. Exceptions will require additional permission.


## Assignments and Grading


#### CONFERENCES (2.5 points ea. / 5% total)

Each student will meet with the instructor twice for online, one-on-one conferences. These conferences will take place between weeks 2 & 3 and weeks 7 & 8.

#### DISCUSSIONS (10 points ea. / 20% total)

Each week will be a discussion question for you to explore. These should be 100+ words. I would like you to then comment on two of your peer’s postings. Your post AND your comments should be submitted by the due date, so please don’t wait until the last minute (your classmates need something to comment on!). Activities conducted in class fall under the same heading because they will always be collaborative endeavors. While your task might not be a written post, these assignments will still ask you to engage with your classmates’ contributions. 

#### SHORT ASSIGNMENTS (20 points each / 25%)

These smaller assignments will help you scaffold the kind of information and research you need for MAJOR ASSIGNMENTS (below). Sometimes, we will share these assignments through a discussion board, but they are different from “DISCUSSION BOARD” assignments. The purpose of sharing them through discussion boards is simply to get some feedback, not to spark debate. These assignments will also ask you to go above and beyond understanding and/or responding to the assigned essays for that week. Short assignments might include an experiment, a creative project, or possibly a draft of a larger research paper.

#### MAJOR ASSIGNMENTS (100 points each / 40%)

We will have three MAJOR ASSIGNMENTS this term. 

##### Module 1: The Historical Conditions of Digital Cultures and Ecology

Based on our readings and your own personal experiences, what is one major historical contribution to the present-day relationship between ecology and digital tech/culture (e.g. privacy & surveillance, algorithmic bias, data storage, conflict minerals, exploited labor, and so forth)? To answer this question, students will write a medium-sized essay that draws on course readings, personal experience, and/or basic research (newspaper & magazine articles, are a good source for this assignment). Our mission is to understand how history sets up the conditions that foster current ecodigital divides. 

##### Module 2: Owning the Rhetoric of Responsibility: An Advertisement and Rhetorical Analysis

In the second Major Assignment, students will explore the relationship between digital tech/cultures and ecology by making an advertisement for a present-day tech company, accompanied by a short rhetorical analysis of your advertisement. This assignment is really designed to help us understand how visual and linguistic modalities can convince us that tech companies and their products somehow operate “outside” of ecological systems. The question is, is it possible to actually own the rhetoric of responsibility, or must responsibility always be consigned to a disingenuous performance of “technoliberalism” (Smith)? 

##### Module 3: Tentacular Designs for the Future

The final Major Assignment, our crowning achievement, will be a multimodal, multimedial, multigenric, and even multispecies story about a more just and sustainable future. This storytelling exercise might take the form of a graphic novel, a short film, a video game, or some other art object that combines various elements. This story will like go beyond “mere entertainment.” As many of the examples we will examine demonstrate, tentacular storytelling is about sharing, responsibility, and perhaps, preparedness. Sharing with and responsibility to whom, and preparedness for what, will depend on the story you tell.  

#### REFLECTIONS (10 points each / 10% total)

Following each module, we will submit reflective essays. At 10% of your grade, these reflections are very important. They should demonstrate an understanding of the outcomes fulfilled. Additionally, students will reflect on how the skills acquired in class will apply outside of class. Last, and most important, students can use these reflections to discuss how they feel about their research, their findings, and how it all relates to their world and the world at large. Students are encouraged here to make connections, to course materials, to previous or simultaneous classes, as well as current events.

# Course Schedule

Please note that the following is a ‘working schedule.’ Class materials are subject to change based on the interests, understanding, and general pace of the class.  Changes and announcements will be made in class and through email and Announcements (on Canvas).

## Module 1.1: The Human Center of the Past: Nature and Slavery, or the Other Side of the Page

### Week 1: Eco-nomic Origins of the Information Age: Mathematizing Humans, Flora, and Fauna

This week is dedicated to understanding how the relationship between digital technology and ecology is actually rooted in a centuries-long effort to reduce people (usually Black, Brown, Indigenous, or other marginalized groups), plant-life, and animals to numbers and disposable or substitutable things. It will also argue that this tendency to subordinate one group of humans for the benefit of White supremacy is part and parcel with liberal Enlightenment humanism. 
For the final project, we will just explore the community partner’s site in depth, and familiarize ourselves with their problem, purpose, audience, medium, and genre.

## Module 1.2: The Human Center of the Past: Nature and Slavery, or the Other Side of the Page

### WEEK 2: The Romantic Response: “Self,” “Nature,” and Print Media/Mediation, circa 1800

In Europe, at the end of the 1700s, it could be argued that the Enlightenment was coming to an end and there was the emergence of what today we commonly refer to as Romanticism. If the Enlightenment privileged science and placed “the human” at the center of the universe, in some respects, Romanticism understands that science has its moral limits (for instance, see Mary Shelley’s gothic masterpiece, Frankenstein) and that humans are not entirely separate from nature. Romanticism is very much a philosophy about the way all things are connected. But Romanticism comes with its own problems. This week we will think about how Romanticism shifted the our understanding of “humanism,” the important role that literary texts and reading played in this shifting understanding, and how these forms of mediation may have actually contributed to prolonging the sufferings of Indigenous, Black, and Brown people and ecological systems, in large part through the construction of “Nature” and the “self.”

## WEEK 3: Who We Are and Who Gets to Be: Authors/Activists/Designers (Lab, Jan 21)

In any rhetorical situation, we want to think about the author, the text, and the audience. Problems and purposes belong to the author (week 2). In addition, we also need to think about our identity as authors/designers. Consider that for thousands of years, organizations and entire states have oppressed women and excluded them from education. So, when a man steps in to “explain” something to a woman, there is a whole history of oppression compressed in that act, and thereby it is no surprise that the explanation is unwelcomed. Likewise, we need to ask ourselves, as college students (even nontraditional), what history and meaning might be associated with us in the eyes of our audiences? This week we will turn a critical eye on ourselves. 

This week we also need to draft a proposal regarding our project for our community partner. We will model our proposal on professional UX proposals.

## WEEK 4: Audiences and Affordances (Class, Jan 28)

We know from studying digital media and globalization (DICE4020) that many corporations swoop in after a natural or economic disaster and use a community’s vulnerability to their advantage, an important component of “the shock doctrine.” The question is: Where were these companies before the disaster? If you’re only there to help when someone is at “rock bottom,” are you really there to help, or are you preying on someone at their most vulnerable moment? These kinds of questions belong to rhetoric, and this week we will think rhetorically about the people we wish to serve, when is the right time to offer services (and for how long), how should we serve (what media should we use, what are appropriate genres, what are the most useful and socially responsible tools or software), what are we convincing others (and ourselves) of, and ultimately, why are we doing it? 

UX testing requires that we have test subjects, and those test subjects need direction. This direction comes in the form of a series of questions, which we will start to develop this week.

## WEEK 5: Tools, Sites, Media, and Modalities (Lab, Feb 4)

If you wanted to present information to a group of elementary school students, you might be less successful if you show up with a bunch of graphs, charts, and statistical figures to back up your claims (instead, consider puppets!). This is an issue of audience and knowing which modalities, generic conventions, and media will be received best by them. This week we consider the rhetoric and the epistemological significance of the tools, sites, media, and modalities (visual, spatial, linguistic, oral, and so forth) we use in social justice work in a digital domain. 

We also need to decide what tools we want to use in our own UX project. We will survey the tools available to us, and think about the media and modalities we want to use to present our findings from these tools.

One of the most important lessons from Judith Butler, Eve Kosofsky Sedgwick, and their ilk is this: No body is the same. Usually when we make something, we make it according to our own body. So if I make a table, I make it according to my height. But not everyone is the same height as me. Is it possible to make other tables? Is it possible to make adjustable tables? Similar situations can be found online. This week, we think about what accessibility means, how we have arrived at our current levels of accessibility, and the legal concerns tied to accessibility. 

This week we also begin our testing. First, we have to recruit some test subjects. We will also want to make sure that we are including accessibility issues within this testing, so we may have to go back and revise our usability questions before getting started.

## WEEK 7: Accessibility, part II: Research, Testing, Design (Lab, Feb 18)

Now that we have situated accessibility within a larger history, now we need to think about how we can incorporate it into our designs. For instance, the syllabus you are currently reading has been organized using headings (h1, h2, h3, h4). These headings make it easier to navigate for someone using a screen reader. While this simple fix will not eliminate all accessibility issues, we must strive to constantly improve our online documents, tools, and sites so that they can accommodate as many folks as possible. 

This week, we may still be scheduling and running UX testing sessions. That’s fine. Hopefully, the data is starting to pour in and we can start thinking about how to organize this data, what it means, and how we want to re-present it to others.

# Module 3: Deliverables, Presentations, and Reflections

## WEEK 8: Deliverables and Proposal Revisions (Class, Feb 25)

By now we should have all of our data and we should no longer be running usability tests. Based on the data we have at this point, what changes, if any, do we think our client/partner should make to their site? Can we design something that helps them imagine what an alternative might look like? Last, do we need to make any revisions to our proposal? Did we run tests that we did not originally recommend? Are we fulfilling our goals/outcomes? Let’s adjust the proposal so that it reflects what we are actually doing and what we’re actually going to accomplish.

## WEEK 9: Social Justice as a Framework for Presenting (Lab, Mar 4)

Isn’t a presentation just a presentation? Your presentation can’t be informed by social justice, can it? It can! This week, we will read a number of shorter pieces from academics working on racial justice and disability justice, and think about how we can apply their principles and recommendations into our own presentation for our community partner.

## WEEK 10: Reflections (Class, Mar 11)

This week we present our findings to our community partner. Hooray! You’ve made it. But we also want to think about the future of social justice and digital media, and what role they might play in our own lives following the conclusion of our class.
