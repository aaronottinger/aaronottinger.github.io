1.	Create a virtual environment in Python (see Dylan Medinaâ€™s tutorial [here](https://youtu.be/_fCazmtnUzY)). 

2.	Install natural language processing toolkit: 

`pip install nltk`

Either a successful installation of NLTK will follow, or you may find that it has already been installed. 

3. Now open up Python (if the natural language toolkit was already installed, make sure that you're using the corresponding version of Python), and "import" the Natural Language Toolkit. 

`import nltk`
