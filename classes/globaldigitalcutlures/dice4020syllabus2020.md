# DICE 4020: Global Digital Cultures

**Autumn 2020**

**Online:** Asynchronous

**Instructor:** Dr. Aaron Ottinger

**Email:** aottinger@seattleu.edu

**Office:** By Appointment

## Course Overview 

We live in an increasingly connected world. At times, it also feels like we’re living in an increasingly divided world. The 45th president of the United States has often mythologized this division by calling out “globalists.” Of course, this is a strange pejorative name to sling at others for someone who licenses his name to multinational corporations and owns hotels, golf courses, and more around the globe, from Turkey to Scotland and beyond. So what does this president really mean when he calls out “globalists”? Is not everyone a globalist in an age of globalization? Maybe. But what about, for instance, a migrant from Central America, without an office or highspeed internet connection? It may surprise some students to see how even precarious laborers are also deeply embedded in a digitally connected, globalized planet. 

So perhaps we need a better understanding of globalization. And because we are the department of digital technology and cultures, it makes good sense to explore this and related concepts through a digital technology framework. After all, it is difficult to imagine such a connected planet without social networking, digital financial markets, as well as digital policing and surveillance. 

In our class we are going to focus on the intersection of digital technology and globalization. First, we must define globalization and develop some vocabulary for talking about it. Once we've defined our terms, we will outline the larger theoretical conversation surrounding globalization, including its critics. Third, does globalization cancel out the local? Put another way, how does our city of Seattle fit into the story of globalization? Once we've addressed the local/global divide, we will turn our attention to the interconnected relationships between corporations, news media, and human emotions, including some first-hand work with and assessment of “sentiment analysis” using Python. Last, our investigation will turn to politics, labor, and social justice on a global scale and in digital domains. While it might seem like the environment or ecology is a missing link in this story, that gap will be filled in Spring 2021 with the class, Digital Culture and Ecology, for which the present course will be a useful precursor. 


## Aknowledgements 

>I would like to thank Eugenia Zuroski for recommending Necropolitics (to be fair, she just recommended it to everyone on Twitter!) and Jeff Janosik for making us dinner and talking to me about Marx in the age of globalization. 


## Course Outcomes 

The Course Outcomes for this class are the same as the Learning Outcomes for the department. However, to make sense of these outcomes in the context of a History of Text Technologies, each outcome will require a little qualification. In addition, every assignment in this course corresponds with one or more Learning Outcome. In each assignment, the corresponding Learning Outcomes will be qualified further to illustrate how it fits the task at hand.

### 1. EXPLAIN KEY CONCEPTS IN COMPUTING: This outcome focuses your ability to explain key concepts in computing, media production, and internet-enabled communication.

Throughout the term, there will be key concepts introduced related the digital technology, digital culture, and globalization (e.g. "neoliberalism"). It's important to recognize that concepts are not static. The evolve over time. Sometimes, they evolve even in the course of one's own career (e.g. Judith Butler's concept of "performativity"). So keep in mind that concepts, and the language we use to discuss them, change. While we may turn to certain people as authorities on certain concepts, even those authorities often struggle with pinning down their meaning. The same can be said for concepts in the sciences and math, but concepts tend to be even more flexible in the human/social or moral-aesthetic domain.

### 2. EVALUATE RESEARCH SOURCES & DIGITAL TOOLS: This outcome focuses on your ability to evaluate the relative strengths and weaknesses of research sources, digital tools, interfaces, and technologies. 

Students will encounter a number of critics, historians, and theorists throughout the term, and will have opportunities to compare, contrast, and synthesize these theories and outlooks. Unlike in the History of Text Technologies, we will largely focus on contemporary digital tech. That said, we may evaluage different versions of the same contemporary technology (e.g. "Which search engine is the most racist?").

### 3. ANALYZE TECHNOLOGY USING INTERDISCIPLINARY THEORIES & METHODS: This outcome focuses on your ability to analyze new and emerging media using interdisciplinary theories and methods. 

In this class we will largely use theories and analytic methods from Marxim, psychoanlaysis, poststructuralism, and posthumanism, especially with respect to the terms "identity," "individual," "subject," "citizen," and so forth. Our methods will also derive from rhetoric and sociology.  

### 4. EXAMINE TECHNOLOGICALLY MEDIATED IDENTITIES: This outcome focuses on your ability to examine how technology changes sense of self and transforms ideologies of gender, nationality, ethnicity, sexuality, and social class. 

One of the fundamental questions of this class is: Who is included and excluded as a digital identity? We can abbreviate this question: Who matters? But we probably need to add: Who matters digitally? Along similar lines, we wiil ask, how do digital spaces contribute to the construction of a subject and an identity? We will also consider how digital platforms, especially video games, facilitate communities. Last, we will think about how digital technology determines who is a citizens and the citizen's relaitonship to the state.  

### 5. DESIGN MULTIMODAL PROJECTS: This outcome focuses on your ability to design socially responsible multimodal projects using digital rhetoric and audience engagement strategies. 

Students will write traditional, college-level research papers, but they will also create multimodal projects involving visual, linguistic, and possibly an array of other modes.

### 6. REFLECTION: This outcome focuses on your ability to reflect upon your own work, roles, values, and identities related to digital culture and engagement with social justice issues.

Rather than ask students to wait until the end of the course to share their personal thoughts and feelings with respect to course materials, each module will end with a reflection. Students will complete three reflections overall. 

## Communication 

### Face-to-Face

I am available meet to "face-to-face" online via Zoom meetings. We will have face-to-face conferences twice during the term, once early on and once towards the end. These meetings will be conducted via Zoom. 

 
### Email

Please email me any questions you have at any time. I recommend using the Canvas email tool ("Inbox" located on the far left navigation bar). But you are welcome to email me directly through the seattleu email system (Outlook). 

While you may email me at any hour, I am more likely to respond to student emails from 9am-6pm, Monday through Friday. I will check email less frequently after 6pm. On the weekends, I will do my best to check and respond to email but that is also time for me to get away from the office and unplug. So beware: if you want to make sure your questions are answered, get them in by the end of the workday on Friday. 

Please allow 24 hours for responses. 

 
### Slack

This class will not use a private Slack channel, but the instructor does post announcements on the #General Slack channel for the whole department. Also Slack is great for sharing news, commenting on the work of your peers, answering questions, and just staying in touch. 

 
### Twitter

I love Twitter (@AaronOttinger). I often post things that I think will be interesting for students using the hashtag #DICE3020. Nothing I post here is required and I will likely crosspost on Slack. The great thing about Twitter is that we can connect with other working professionals that might be able to help us in our discussions. Feel free to engage with me on this platform as well.


## Required Tools and Software

It is recommended that you start by watching the CDLI's [Student Orientation to Distance Learning](https://www.seattleu.edu/cdli/instructional-continuity/student-orientation/).

This course will be fully online, therefore you will need access to an up-to-date device that is capable of playing videos, recording videos and using a camera. If your computer is capable of playing multimedia but doesn't have a webcam, you may be able to use your mobile device to record and upload videos. 

It is essential that you have a reliable broadband network connection available during the course. We recommend cable broadband, DSL, or for mobile devices, availability of LTE. Use of satellite broadband services or WIMAX services such as Clear may not have sufficient bandwidth to allow successful participation in this course. If you can watch Netflix or YouTube videos on high definition without lags, it is likely your broadband connection is sufficient. You should also be aware that some countries block content, such as YouTube videos. If you will be traveling to a country that may block content, please talk to me right away.

### Software

Most of this course will take place within the learning management system Canvas. For their final project, students will also have the opportunity to work with the R programming environment. We will download R in the early weeks of the course to address any issues before the software is required for the course. 


## Community Agreements (student generated)

### Think before acting

- Employ anti-violent, inclusive communication (think about connotations of language, e.g. "lame" is often used as a pejorative adjective. Who would likely find this usage hurtful?) 

- Avoid speaking over one another

### Empower one another

- Be okay with being questioned, but challenge and question with respect (avoid personal attacks)

- Offer solutions

- Ask questions, encourage, and challenge one another. 

### Be accountable

- Be Punctual 

- Be willing to apologize

- Be willing to forgive



## Diversity, Growth, and Future Application

I recognize and respect the diversity of races, genders, sexual identities, classes, ages, and abilities. Differences provide us with opportunities to learn new things, compare experiences, understand ourselves better, and find common ground. Differences also sometimes engender conflict. In the midst of that conflict, I ask everyone to maintain a language and an attitude of respect. 

Bear in mind that some opinions and materials in this class might challenge our personal views and beliefs. But if the goal in this class is to grow cognitively and emotionally, students and the instructor are expected to question the limitations of our personal histories to make room for the personal views and experiences of others. 

Last, consider that the path to emotional and intellectual growth may not be won by challenging one’s own personal beliefs and values only. To embrace new ideas, skills, and values for future use in different contexts, we must also conduct personal investigations that ask why our views are being challenged in the first place. Accordingly, it is always worth asking “Why do I feel x?”, “Why do I believe x?”, and “Why do I value x?” Ultimately, this course is not solely intended to increase our knowledge about a list of terms; more importantly, the task is to alter the fundamental ways in which we understand ourselves and our relationship to ourselves and others within a digital culture.


## Self Care and Caring for One Another

This classroom is a place where everyone is welcome and should feel like they matter. Everyone is encouraged to advocate for themselves. Here are some items to consider:      

**1. Move if you need to: You know your body best.** 

If you need to get up, sit down, go to the bathroom, and so forth, please do so. You do not need permission. This one may be less applicable online, but it does apply to online, one-on-one conferences.

**2. Stay home if you need to:** 

A little less applicable in an online class, it's still  important to let the instructor know if you cannot attend an online meeting. You are encouraged to email the instructor ahead of time, but you do not have to reveal why. Simply stating that you are not well is enough. But if you feel like you need to explain, you are also invited to do so.      

**3. Eat/drink if you need to:** 

If you need to eat or drink in class, please do so. But please try to avoid foods that are going to disrupt your neighbor’s learning. Really pungent or noisy foods might best be saved for the cafeteria. Also, be mindful of spaces (like computer labs) where food is not allowed. Feel free to take a break from these spaces if you need food or drink.       

**4. Speak up, slow down, repeat, stop:**

During lectures and discussions, we may need things said again or slowed down. You are encouraged to ask.      

**5. Be aware of your classmates’ feelings:** 

If someone looks like they are not doing well, ask them, “Are you okay?” Let’s not ignore one another. Let’s not let anyone go unnoticed—unless, of course, someone expresses that they would like to be left alone. Then leave them alone.

**6. In light of the coronavirus: Stay home, wash your hands frequently, and don't touch your face:** 

While we are trying to proceed as normal, there is nothing normal about a pandemic, and everyone is encouraged to follow state guidelines and to take necessary precautions. Please visit [the CDC's website regarding the Coronavirus disease (covid-19)](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/index.html).

## Course Policies


### Assignment Deadlines and Extensions

Assignments should be submitted at the designated due date/time. If a student requies an extension, they should request one from the instructor 24 hours in advance. 

#### Extended Extensions

All assignments from the first four weeks of the quarter will be due no later than the start of week 5. This hard deadline is automatic. Exceptions will require additional permission.

All assignments from the second four weeks of the quarter will be due no later than the start of week 9. This hard deadline is automatic. Exceptions will require additional permission.

## Assignments and Grading 

This course follows a three-module sequence, with each module representing a distinct period in the history of text technologies (ancient, modern, digital). The infographic below outlines this trajectory, starting with an introductory module that asks what we mean by a history of text technologies, followed by a module on ancient reading and writing technologies, succeeded by a section on modern text technologies (from the printing press to the typewriter), and concluding with a module on digital text technologies and a final reflection. Details regarding the kinds of individual assignments are below. 

#### CONFERENCES (2.5 points ea. / 5% total)

Each student will meet with the instructor twice for online, one-on-one conferences. These conferences will take place between weeks 2 & 3 and weeks 7 & 8.

#### DISCUSSIONS (10 points ea. / 10% total)

Each week we will have 1-2 discussion board assignments. Typically, these discussion board assignments give students a chance to entertain, challenge, and demonstrate their understanding of course materials. Plus, discussion boards tie into short assignments, which in turn prepare students for major assignments. 

#### SHORT ASSIGNMENTS (20 points ea. / 30% total)

Short Assignments are designed to help students get a jumpstart on Major Assignments. They are smaller in scope and lower in stakes. They also allow students to receive feedback before reaching a more critical or decisive point within their research and work. 

#### MAJOR ASSIGNMENTS (100 points / 45% total)

Major assignments wrap up each module. They synthesize what has been read and discussed for each module, and so they tend to cover 2-3 weeks worth of materials. 

- Major Assignment 1: Representing Ourselves in Video Games

Major assignment 1 is a traditional college-level essay. Following our first example of Rousseau's Discourse on Inequality, students select a form of early lexigraphic writing from one of the five times/regions examined and meditate on how this particular form of writing might have determined (in part) the epistemic state of a particular community in history. As a somewhat speculative endeavor, students are encouraged to use their imagination, while at the same time grounding their claims in the historical and theoretical research discussed in class.

- Major Assignment 2: The Shock of the Old

Major assignment 2 is a multimodal project, part video and part historical analysis/reflection. For this module, students will select a text technology of their choosing, from the early modern period through the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. They will investigate how this object differs from its present-day iteration, if applicable, with particular focus on the way the object included and/or excluded particular audiences. Students will reflect on how this text technology, by virtue of who it included or excluded, shaped values, beliefs, and or world views.

- Major Assignment 3: Hyper Reading in Context

In the third module, students will conclude by asking: How does hyper, distant, or machine-assisted reading compare to the print technologies of the past. How does it affect how we read and thus how we think? Last, we want to know if this kind of reading is more inclusive or if it merely introduces an old form of exclusion dressed in digital clothes.

#### REFLECTIONS (10 points ea. / 10% total)

Following major assignment sequences 1, 2 and 3, students will submit reflective essays. These reflective essays demonstrate an understanding of the outcomes fulfilled. Additionally, students will reflect on how the skills acquired in class will apply outside of class. Last, students can use these reflections to discuss how they feel about their research, their findings, and how it all relates to their world and the world at large.
