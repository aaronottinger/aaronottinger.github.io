	<h1>Bio</h1>
<div class=content>
	<p>
The many interests of my past have come to inform my research and pedagogical strategies, forming a blend of critical and creative ways to
	think, feel, read, and write. From a childhood filled with drawing, 
	many cartoon teaching documents have followed; I often include graphic novels in my reading lists; and in many cases, 
	I have encouraged students to access literary texts by adapting them to comic book form. Even the theater plays an important
	role in my teaching, as I appeal to students' reasoning faculties as well as their emotions--not to mention integrating the occasional in-class skit. 
	My current research remains focused on the legacy of the Enlightenment, but I am now investigating how we mathematize everyday human life. Of course, taking this
	direction is not to say that I disavow math and science. On the contrary, I approach these fields with wonder and respect. But, as the cautionary
	tale of Mary Shelley's <em>Frankenstein</em> tells us, just because we can do something does 
	not mean we should.
