	<h1>Bio</h1>
<div class=content>
	<p>
		As an academic researcher and instructor, I integrate professional and personal domains, in what I call "learning as
		a mode of living," which I have written about <a href="https://nassrgrads.hcommons.org/2012/09/08/back-to-school-time-to-learn/">here</a>.
	</p>
	
	<p>
		In short, I find that my research and teaching inform my life and how I live, and conversely, my life and how I live inform
		my research and teaching. For instance, I believe that to communicate better with friends and family, I have
		to make myself more vulnerable to others' feelings. There is a good case to be made for practicing something
		similar in the classroom. Along the same line, what better time period to study with respect to this topic than 
		the eighteenth century, when philosophers and literary authors were first formulating their ideas on 
		sympathy and sentiment? 
	</p>
	<p>
		Furthermore, coming from a family of artists, and with a background in theater, it comes as no surprise that my 
		love of literature has extended to the world of media studies, multimodal composition, and most recently, digital storytelling. 
		Put another way, I love integrating the cerebral arena of academic study with moving the body and getting my hands dirty, which
		is a good way to describe my classroom too. 
	</p>
	<p>
		Last, as someone who struggles with an auto-immune disease, which peaked while pursuing my PhD, I have become 
		especially concerned with food and the environment, and how these elements come to bear on cognitive and affective 
		processes. Hence, I have written on ecocritical perspectives, the gut as part of the
		cognitive nonconscious, and I am routinely teaching classes on digital materiality, 
		ecocriticism, and ecocentric-literature and artworks, from Shakespeare's 
		<i>The Tempest</i> to <a href="http://www.janavirgin.com/">Joana Moll's digital eco-art</a>.
