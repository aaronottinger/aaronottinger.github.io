	<h1>Bio</h1>
<div class=content>
	<p>
		Working in academia is a strange thing: In some jobs, one might feel that they can really separate their professional
		from their personal life. As an academic researcher and instructor, I actually strive to integrate these two spheres, in what I call 
		"learning as a mode of living," which I have written about <a href="https://nassrgrads.hcommons.org/2012/09/08/back-to-school-time-to-learn/">here</a>.
	</p>
	
	<p>
		In short, I find that my research and teaching inform my life and how I live, and conversely, my life and how I live inform
		my research and teaching. For instance, I believe that to communicate better with friends and family, I have
		to make myself more vulnerable to others' feelings. There is a good case to be made for practicing something
		similar in the classroom. Along the same line, what better time period to study with respect to this topic than 
		the eighteenth century, when philosophers and literary authors were first formulating their ideas on 
		sympathy and sentiment? 
	</p>
	<p>
		I can't possibly detail all the ways my life has informed my research and teaching, but coming from a family of 
		artists and with a theater background, these creative outlets certainly come to bear on both. Certainly, this 
		background accounts for my interest in media studies, multimodal composition, and most recently, digital storytelling. 
	</p>
	<p>
		Last, as someone who has struggled with an auto-immune disease, which peaked as a graduate student, I have become 
		especially concerned with the food we eat, climate, and the environment, and how these elements affect our 
		bodies, including our thoughts, feelings, and attention. Hence, I am routinely teaching classes on ecocriticism, the
		relationship between ecology and digital media, and ecocentric literature and artworks, from Shakespeare's 
		<i>The Tempest<i> to <a href="http://www.janavirgin.com/">Joana Moll's digital artworks</a>.
		(2016).
