<p>
As a child, I was obsessed with the "Forestmen Lego" collection. One day when I was 
building, creating a story for my figurines, my brother paused, looked down on my childish
activity, and declared, "One day you'll like space," by which he meant the "Space Lego" collection, 
featuring spaceships, ray guns, and robots. 

<br>

He was right. But I never gave up on my love of history. Today, I continue to play, create, 
and imagine stories, only now they are based on actual historical figures, things, and events, 
and their narrative spans hundreds of years, from the Scientific Revolution to the Digital Revolution.
