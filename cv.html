<div class="bio">
	<p>
	My parents and older brother are all visual artists, and growing up I loved drawing, painting, and making little, misshapen clay bowls. By the time I entered college, I was a dedicated student of the theater. 
	But something took hold and by my second year, I was officially a philosophy major. I also saw myself as a bit of a writer, dabbling in fiction, 
	poetry, and drama. This combination of philosophy and literature eventually drove me to the English department. It helped that the first English 
	class I took was the required theory course, where I became acquainted with Feminism, post-structuralism, and cultural criticism. As a senior project, 
	I traveled to Cambodia where I studied representations of genocide through public works and museums. This might seem like a far cry from my current 
	research, but it was actually my introduction to the critique of Enlightenment and the dark underbelly of colonialism (which is not to suggest that 
	there is a bright side). 
	<br>
	<br>
	Today, these seemingly remote paths and interests have come to inform my research and pedagogical strategies. From a childhood filled with drawing 
	and making comics, I have developed many cartoon teaching documents; I often include graphic novels in my reading lists; and in many cases, 
	I have encouraged students to access literary texts by adapting them to comic book form. Even the theater plays an important
	role in my teaching, as I appeal to students' reasoning faculties and their emotions, not to mention the occasional skit or acting game. 
	Last, my research continues to focus on the rise of "mathematizing human life" (this is also the theme of my English 101 classes). Taking this
	direction is not to say that I disavow math and science. On the contrary, I approach these fields with wonder and fascination. But, as the cautionary
	tales of Mary Shelley's <em>Frankenstein</em> and Kazuo Ishiguro's <em>Never Let Me Go</em> teach us, just because we can do something does 
	not mean we should.
