<div class="bio">
	<p>
	My parents and older brother are all visual artists, and growing up I loved drawing, painting, and playing with a whole range of media. By the time I entered college, I was a dedicated student of the theater. 
	But something took hold and by my second year, I was officially a philosophy major. I also viewed myself as a bit of a writer, dabbling in fiction, 
	poetry, and drama. This combination of philosophy and literature eventually drove me to the English department. The first 
	class I took acquainted me with Feminism, post-structuralism, and cultural criticism. For my senior thesis, 
	I traveled to Cambodia where I studied representations of genocide through public works and museums. A project focusing on SE Asia might seem like a far cry from my current 
	research, but it was actually an application of everything I had learned regarding the critique of Enlightenment and the dark underbelly of colonialism.
	<br>
	<br>
	Today, these seemingly remote paths and interests have come to inform my research and pedagogical strategies. From a childhood filled with drawing, 
	many cartoon teaching documents have followed; I often include graphic novels in my reading lists; and in many cases, 
	I have encouraged students to access literary texts by adapting them to comic book form. Even the theater plays an important
	role in my teaching, as I appeal to students' reasoning faculties as well as their emotions--not to mention the occasional in-class skit or acting game. 
	And my research continues to focus on the legacy of the Enlightenment, focusing especially on how we mathematize everyday human life. Taking this
	direction is not to say that I disavow math and science. On the contrary, I approach these fields with wonder and respect. But, as the cautionary
	tales of Mary Shelley's <em>Frankenstein</em> and Kazuo Ishiguro's <em>Never Let Me Go</em> teach us, just because we can do something does 
	not mean we should.
