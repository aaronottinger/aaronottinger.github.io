# DICE4030: Multimodal Composition, Spring 2020

**Instructor:** Dr. Aaron Ottinger

**Email:** aottinger@seattleu.edu

**Office:** Online

**Office Hours:** Mondays 4:30-5:30 or by appointment

## Course Overview 

A multimodal composition uses a combination of text, images, video, audio, graphics and interactivity in a format that allows each medium to contribute without redundancy. In this course you will explore multimodal compositions in a variety of formats, and learn to create both linear and non-linear story “packages.” The course is project-based, and each week you’ll work on one step in the development of a final project. You’ll also learn to analyze multimodal composition carefully and gain awareness of the expressive and informational strengths of each medium.

## Course Outcomes 

Program Outcomes for DICE (from the program outcomes)
    
I. EXPLAIN KEY CONCEPTS IN COMPUTING: This outcome focuses your ability to explain key concepts in computing, media production, and internet-enabled communication.

Throughout the course we will encounter familiar and new terms with respect to digital culture and multimodal composition. Part of succeeding in a professional domain is knowing the vocabulary and how to employ it, so it is essential that students learn terms and rehearse their usage. 

II. EVALUATE RESEARCH SOURCES & DIGITAL TOOLS: This outcome focuses on your ability to evaluate the relative strengths and weaknesses of research sources, digital tools, interfaces, and technologies.

Evaluate different theories of mutlimodal composition
Evaluate a variety of tools for multimodal composition

III. ANALYZE TECHNOLOGY USING INTERDISCIPLINARY THEORIES & METHODS: This outcome focuses on your ability to analyze new and emerging media using interdisciplinary theories and methods.

Use rhetorical analysis to assess how multimodal compositions exclude specific audiences and help to create new publics

V. DESIGN MULTIMODAL PROJECTS: This outcome focuses on your ability to design socially responsible multimodal projects using digital rhetoric and audience engagement strategies.

Research and plan multimodal compositions using Cornell notes, sticky note summaries, image sketches, storyboarding, and other organizational strategies
Craft effective "narratives" using rhetorical strategies and appropriate mixes of media
Produce photographs with an awareness of composition and design conventions
Create a well-crafted 5-shot video sequence with live or added audio
Demonstrate proficiency with user-centered design principles through both flow charts of user interaction and navigation and in the final product
Demonstrate familiarity with site prototyping and social media planning

VI. REFLECTION: This outcome focuses on your ability to reflect upon your own work, roles, values, and identities related to digital culture and engagement with social justice issues.

Reflect on how multimodal compositions function rhetorically and how they determine publics.
Reflect on how multimodal composition will be applicable and effective in personal and professional settings outside the classroom.

 


## Communication 

### Face-to-Face

I am available meet "face-to-face" online via Zoom meetings. We will have face-to-face conferences twice during the term, once early on and once towards the end. These meetings will be conducted via Zoom. 

 
### Email

Please email me any questions you have at any time. I recommend using the Canvas email tool ("Inbox" located on the far left navigation bar). But you are welcome to email me directly through the seattleu email system (Outlook). 

While you may email me at any hour, I am more likely to respond to student emails from 9am-6pm, Monday through Friday. I will check email less frequently after 6pm. On the weekends, I will do my best to check and respond to email but that is also time for me to get away from the office and unplug. So beware: if you want to make sure your questions are answered, get them in by the end of the workday on Friday. 

Please allow 24 hours for responses. 

 
### Slack

This class will not use a private Slack channel, but the instructor does post announcements on the #General Slack channel for the whole department. Also Slack is great for sharing news, commenting on the work of your peers, answering questions, and just staying in touch. 

 
### Twitter

I love Twitter (@AaronOttinger). I often post things that I think will be interesting for students using the hashtag #DICE4030. Nothing I post here is required and I will likely crosspost on Slack. The great thing about Twitter is that we can connect with other working professionals that might be able to help us in our discussions. Feel free to engage with me on this platform as well.

## Required Tools and Software

It is recommended that you start by watching the CDLI's [Student Orientation to Distance Learning](https://www.seattleu.edu/cdli/instructional-continuity/student-orientation/).

This course will be fully online, therefore you will need access to an up-to-date device that is capable of playing videos, recording videos and using a camera. If your computer is capable of playing multimedia but doesn't have a webcam, you may be able to use your mobile device to record and upload videos. 

It is essential that you have a reliable broadband network connection available during the course. We recommend cable broadband, DSL, or for mobile devices, availability of LTE. Use of satellite broadband services or WIMAX services such as Clear may not have sufficient bandwidth to allow successful participation in this course. If you can watch Netflix or YouTube videos on high definition without lags, it is likely your broadband connection is sufficient. You should also be aware that some countries block content, such as YouTube videos. If you will be traveling to a country that may block content, please talk to me right away.

### Software

Most of this course will take place within the learning management system Canvas.

## Community Agreements (student generated)

### Communication

Be present

Be accountable

Reach out when you need help

Have open, honest discussions

When speaking, be mindful of others (Try: Not raising your hand until others do; don’t raise your hand/speak every time; limit your comments to 1 minute, 2 minutes at most; give credit to others--by name--when you use their ideas; invite others to share, especially those who rarely speak)

If you can’t respond to an email fully, just respond enough

Avoid passive aggressive responses, address individuals directly *when* an issue arises

### Support 

We all belong here regardless of where we come from

Encourage one another (for fresh, new ideas)

Be empathetic (two way sympathy)

## Diversity, Growth, and Future Application

I recognize and respect the diversity of races, genders, sexual identities, classes, ages, and abilities. Differences provide us with opportunities to learn new things, compare experiences, understand ourselves better, and find common ground. Differences also sometimes engender conflict. In the midst of that conflict, I ask everyone to maintain a language and an attitude of respect. 

Bear in mind that some opinions and materials in this class might challenge our personal views and beliefs. But if the goal in this class is to grow cognitively and emotionally, students and the instructor are expected to question the limitations of our personal histories to make room for the personal views and experiences of others. 

Last, consider that the path to emotional and intellectual growth may not be won by challenging one’s own personal beliefs and values only. To embrace new ideas, skills, and values for future use in different contexts, we must also conduct personal investigations that ask why our views are being challenged in the first place. Accordingly, it is always worth asking “Why do I feel x?”, “Why do I believe x?”, and “Why do I value x?” Ultimately, this course is not solely intended to increase our knowledge about a list of terms; more importantly, the task is to alter the fundamental ways in which we understand ourselves and our relationship to ourselves and others within a digital culture.

## Self Care and Caring for Others

This classroom is a place where everyone is welcome and should feel like they matter. Everyone is encouraged to advocate for themselves. Here are some items to consider:      

1. Move if you need to: You know your body best. 

If you need to get up, sit down, go to the bathroom, and so forth, please do so. You do not need permission.      

2. Stay home if you need to: 

A little less applicable in an online class, it's still  important to let the instructor know if you cannot attend an online meeting. You are encouraged to email the instructor ahead of time, but you do not have to reveal why. Simply stating that you are not well is enough. But if you feel like you need to explain, you are also invited to do so.      

3. Eat/drink if you need to: 

If you need to eat or drink in class, please do so. But please try to avoid foods that are going to disrupt your neighbor’s learning. Really pungent or noisy foods might best be saved for the cafeteria. Also, be mindful of spaces (like computer labs) where food is not allowed. Feel free to take a break from these spaces if you need food or drink.       

4. Speak up, slow down, repeat, stop: 

During lectures and discussions, we may need things said again or slowed down. You are encouraged to ask.      

5. Be aware of your classmates’ feelings: 

If someone looks like they are not doing well, ask them, “Are you okay?” Let’s not ignore one another. Let’s not let anyone go unnoticed—unless, of course, someone expresses that they would like to be left alone. Then leave them alone.

6. In light of the coronavirus: Stay home, wash your hands frequently, and don't touch your face: 

While we are trying to proceed as noraml, there is nothing normal about a pandemic, and everyone is encouraged to follow state guidelines and to take necessary precautions. Please visit [the CDC's website regarding the Coronavirus disease (covid-19)](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/index.html).
